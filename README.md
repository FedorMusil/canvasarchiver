# Project Software Engineering: Canvas Archiver

###### Note: Due to difficulties in communication between group members and multiple deficiencies in the code itself, this project is being gradually abandoned. As a result, development has slowed down significantly and may eventually stop completely.


Our project is an innovative extension of the Canvas course management system, designed to enhance online learning and teaching. Primarily intended for course teachers, this tool leverages the Canvas API to construct a detailed timeline of different versions of the courses linked to the application.

## What the Project Does

Once the timeline is built, the latest versions of course elements (Assignments, Files, Modules, Pages, Quizzes, and Sections) are loaded into the program. Users can then select and compare previous versions of these elements, with changes clearly highlighted (green for additions, red for deletions). The latest changes are visible on the product homepage. Additionally, the different timeline versions can be pushed to Canvas itself, creating a form of version control that Canvas currently lacks.

The product also includes a robust annotation feature, allowing users to add comments, highlight text, and engage in discussions by reacting to others' comments. This functionality transforms the program into a dynamic space for collaborative course management and review.

## Why the Project is Useful

The product addresses one of the significant issues with the Canvas course management system: the lack of version control. Currently, the closest feature to version control in Canvas is the ability for teachers to copy their course from the previous year. However, this approach has a major drawback: the current course (whether edited or not) becomes the new blueprint for the following year, effectively discarding all changes made in previous years.
Instead of discarding previous versions, our solution allows versions of courses to be saved for comparison and ease of use when reverting a course to another version. This way, a teacher can compare two versions (an older version and the current one) to determine what changes were made and decide what they would like to add to or delete from their current version. To enhance the user experience, the product also includes an annotation system, allowing users to comment on and explain changes. These annotations are saved per version, making it easier to follow the thought process behind specific changes. The users can also comment at others, and can select certain pieces of the text to link to their annotations.

## Installation and usage

---
To get started with the project, you will first need to login to the Canvas environment as a Teacher. Once logged in, you can select the Canvas Archiver and install it as an add-on. After successfully installing, the user will need to build the frontend. If the frontend is not built, it will not have access to the necessary dependencies and results in a faulty application.
---

## Requirements

---
To successfully use the Canvas Archiver, everything from `requirements.txt` and `package.json` is necessary. A bundle of node modules is expected as well. By meeting these requirements, you'll be well-prepared to get started.
---

Clone the repo:
`git clone git@github.com:FedorMusil/canvasarchiver.git`
Go into /backend and run:
`python3 -m venv venv`
then:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
now navigate to the ../frontend folder
if you dont have npm installed:
`sudo apt install npm`
then:
`npm install`
then to build:
`npm run build`
go back to ../backend 
For this step you should have a running instance of postgress with the credentials in a .env file.

to build the database run:
`python3 db/init-db.py`

It should say: "database created succesfully" 

then at last go back to /backend and to launch run
`python3 program.py`

## Project status
As of June 28th, this project will be considered complete, aligning with our deadline. Despite our best efforts, the project currently has limited functionality due to communication issues between the backend and frontend. Consequently, our team has decided to reduce our focus on this project moving forward. 

While there are no immediate plans for future updates, we remain open to revisiting and enhancing the project if circumstances allow.
