# Project Software Engineering: Canvas Archiver

Our project is an innovative extension of the Canvas course management system, designed to enhance online learning and teaching. Primarily intended for course teachers, this tool leverages the Canvas API to construct a detailed timeline of different versions of the courses linked to the application.

## What the Project Does

Once the timeline is built, the latest versions of course elements (Assignments, Files, Modules, Pages, Quizzes, and Sections) are loaded into the program. Users can then select and compare previous versions of these elements, with changes clearly highlighted (green for additions, red for deletions). The latest changes are visible on the product homepage. Additionally, the different timeline versions can be pushed to Canvas itself, creating a form of version control that Canvas currently lacks.

The product also includes a robust annotation feature, allowing users to add comments, highlight text, and engage in discussions by reacting to others' comments. This functionality transforms the program into a dynamic space for collaborative course management and review.

## Why the Project is Useful

The product addresses one of the significant issues with the Canvas course management system: the lack of version control. Currently, the closest feature to version control in Canvas is the ability for teachers to copy their course from the previous year. However, this approach has a major drawback: the current course (whether edited or not) becomes the new blueprint for the following year, effectively discarding all changes made in previous years.
Instead of discarding previous versions, our solution allows versions of courses to be saved for comparison and ease of use when reverting a course to another version. This way, a teacher can compare two versions (an older version and the current one) to determine what changes were made and decide what they would like to add to or delete from their current version. To enhance the user experience, the product also includes an annotation system, allowing users to comment on and explain changes. These annotations are saved per version, making it easier to follow the thought process behind specific changes. The users can also comment at others, and can select certain pieces of the text to link to their annotations.

## Initial Setup and Login

Before diving into the technical setup, ensure you have access to the Canvas environment with Teacher privileges. This is crucial for the initial steps:

1. Log in to Canvas with your Teacher account.
2. Navigate to the course you for which you want to install the Canvas Archiver.
3. Install the Canvas Archiver as an add-on to your Canvas course.

**Important:** After the installation of the Canvas Archiver, it's essential to proceed with building the application. Without this step, the application will lack the necessary functionality to archive and compare course versions.

Follow the detailed setup instructions in the subsequent sections to complete the installation and configuration of both the frontend and backend components.

## Canvas Archiver Setup Instructions

To ensure a smooth setup for the Canvas Archiver, please follow these instructions carefully. You will need to install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` and `package.json`, along with a bundle of node modules.

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FedorMusil/canvasarchiver.git
```

### Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend` folder and create a virtual environment:

```bash
cd canvasarchiver/backend
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Setup

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd ../frontend
sudo apt install npm
npm install
npm run build
```

### Database Setup

Ensure you have a running instance of PostgreSQL and create a `.env` file with the necessary credentials. Then, navigate back to the `backend` folder and run the following command:

```bash
python3 db/init-db.py
```

If the database is created successfully, you should see the message: "Tables created successfully."

### Launching the Application

Finally, navigate back to the `backend` folder and run the following command to launch the application:

```bash
python3 program.py
```

## Project status

As of June 28th, this project will be considered complete, aligning with our deadline. Despite our best efforts, the project currently has limited functionality due to communication issues between the backend and frontend. Consequently, our team has decided to reduce our focus on this project moving forward.

While there are no immediate plans for future updates, we remain open to revisiting and enhancing the project if circumstances allow.
